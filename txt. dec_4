   ######   notes ::::: ####


** is javascript synchronous or asynchronous?
--> JavaScript is both synchronous and asynchronous



** is javascript single threaded or multi threaded?
--> JavaScript is a single-threaded language

JavaScript is single-threaded because it has one call stack and one memory heap, and it executes code in order. This means that only one piece of code can be executed at a time.

** is javascript dynamically typed or statically  typed language?

--> JavaScript is a dynamically typed language

** what is varaibles and constants 
-->  A variable's value can change during a program's execution. Variables are often represented by small letters, like x, y, or a, but can also be derived from other languages.


** difference between let, var, const?

----------------Array----------------- 
  
An array in JavaScript is a type of global object used to store data. Arrays can store multiple values in a single variable, which can condense and organize our code. JavaScript provides many built-in methods to work with arrays, including mutator, accessor, and iteration methods.

creat an Array 
let car = ["bmw" , "scarpio", "mahindra"]


Access array Elements
 console.log(car[0]);  // output : bmw

Add an Element
 car.pus("toyoto) 

Remove the element
 car.pop();
 console.log(car);

loop through the array
 for (let i = 0; i < car.length; i++){
    console.log(car[i]);
 }


--------////////////---------
----------------Object----------------- 

 an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc.

// Create an Object
const person = {
   Add Properties; 
};

// Add Properties
person.firstName = "John";
person.lastName = "Doe";
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = "blue"

  Array methods
   concat() : joins multiple arays & returns result

   unshift() : add to start

   shift() :  delete from start & return
